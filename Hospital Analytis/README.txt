HOSPITAL RISK ANALYTICS DASHBOARD Advanced Healthcare Risk Monitoring
using SQL & Power BI

==================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Hospital Risk Analytics Project is an end-to-end business
intelligence solution designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize
healthcare risk data. The project focuses on identifying high-risk
patients, evaluating department performance, analyzing operational
efficiency, and enabling data-driven decision-making within hospital
environments.

Using SQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization, this
project converts raw healthcare data into meaningful insights that can
support hospital administrators, department heads, and management teams
in reducing risk and improving service quality.

==================================================================

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Hospitals generate large volumes of patient and operational data daily.
However, without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:

-   Identify high-risk patients early
-   Track department-level risk exposure
-   Monitor cost and treatment efficiency
-   Detect readmission trends
-   Improve patient outcome forecasting

This project aims to solve these challenges through structured data
modeling and interactive dashboard reporting.

==================================================================

3. OBJECTIVES

-   Identify high-risk patients and departments
-   Analyze admission trends and patterns
-   Evaluate treatment cost efficiency
-   Monitor operational KPIs
-   Provide management-ready insights
-   Improve resource allocation strategies
-   Support risk mitigation planning

==================================================================

4. DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE

Step 1: Data Collection Raw hospital data including patient
demographics, treatment costs, department details, diagnosis
information, and admission records.

Step 2: Data Cleaning (SQL) - Removed duplicate records - Handled
missing values - Standardized categorical fields - Created calculated
fields for risk categorization - Generated summary views for dashboard
integration

Step 3: Data Modeling (Power BI) - Built relationships between fact and
dimension tables - Created star schema model - Optimized data
performance

==================================================================

5. TECH STACK

SQL -> Data extraction & transformation Power BI -> Interactive
dashboard creation Excel -> Initial data preprocessing Data Modeling ->
Star schema design Business Analytics -> Insight generation

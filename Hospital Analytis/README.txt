HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT & REVENUE MONITORING SYSTEM SQL + Power BI
Analytics Project

==================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Hospital Appointment & Revenue Monitoring System is a business
intelligence dashboard developed to track hospital appointments,
department performance, and revenue generation.

This dashboard provides a centralized view of hospital operations,
focusing on appointment volume trends and department-wise billing
performance. It enables hospital administrators and management to
monitor operational efficiency and financial health in real-time.

==================================================================

2. DASHBOARD SUMMARY

The dashboard consists of the following key components:

• Total Number of Appointments: 10,000 • Total Billing Amount:
₹14,422,084 • Monthly Appointment Trend Analysis • Department-wise
Billing Comparison • Interactive Department Filters

Departments Included: - Cardiology - General Medicine - Neurology -
Orthopedics - Pediatrics

==================================================================

3. KEY VISUALIZATIONS

A. Number of Appointments (KPI Card) Displays the total number of
appointments recorded across all departments, helping track patient
inflow.

B. Monthly Appointment Trend (Line Chart) Shows appointment fluctuations
from January to December. Key Insight: - Higher appointments in early
months - Stable trend across mid-to-late months - Helps identify
seasonal variations

C. Total Billing Amount (KPI Card) Displays total hospital revenue
generated across all departments.

D. Billing Amount by Department (Bar Chart) Compares department-wise
revenue performance:

-   Cardiology: ₹2.95M (approx.)
-   General Medicine: ₹2.91M (approx.)
-   Neurology: ₹2.88M (approx.)
-   Orthopedics: ₹2.84M (approx.)
-   Pediatrics: ₹2.83M (approx.)

This helps identify high-performing and comparatively lower
revenue-generating departments.

E. Department Filter Panel Interactive filter allowing users to: -
Select specific departments - Analyze performance individually - Compare
billing and appointment trends dynamically
